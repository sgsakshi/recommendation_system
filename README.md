**Project Overview**
This project is a content-based movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on their content. 
The recommendation system is built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Cosine Similarity to compute the similarity between movies.

**Dataset Used:**
-movies.csv: Contains details about movies such as title, genre, overview, and keywords.
-credits.csv: Contains information about the cast and crew associated with each movie.

**Technologies Used**
-Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)
-Natural Language Processing (NLP)
-Count_Vectorizer
-Cosine Similarity

**Future Enhancements**
-Improve recommendations using weighted similarity scores.
-Vectorization using Tf-Idf
